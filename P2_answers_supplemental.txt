Jason Chen and Gerry Lin

1.1) For the ReflexAgent implementation, I used Manhattan distance to calculate the distance to the closest food and ghost.
Then I used these values to help the agent determine its next action.

1.2) The evaluation function that I used was "20 / (foodDistance + 1) - 5 / (scaredGhostDistance + 1)" and . I used 20 for food 
distance so the food that are closest will have higher priority and it produced results that are greater than 1200. I used 5
for the distance from a ghost to prevent Pacman from getting eaten by a ghost. If I used a higher number like 10, sometimes
Pacman will be too scared of the ghost and not progress. For the food distance, if 20 was lower, Pacman would also sometimes 
stay in place to avoid the ghost.
